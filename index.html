            <h2  class="align-to-paragraph">About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a passionate and creative individual best known for my signature pink hair and bold, expressive style. With a strong background in the beauty industry, I’ve always been drawn to the art of transformation—whether through hair or digital design. Recently, I’ve expanded my skills into the world of front-end development, driven by a desire to grow, learn, and challenge myself in new ways. My journey into coding reflects the same energy I bring to everything I do: vibrant, curious, and constantly evolving. I thrive on blending aesthetics with functionality, and I’m excited to keep building beautiful, user-friendly digital experiences that reflect both my creativity and technical ambition.</p>

            </header>

            <p>My journey in the hairdressing industry began in 2014, when I started studying and working at the prestigious corporate salon, Gary Rom. Through dedication, hard work, and a passion for the craft, I quickly rose through the ranks—achieving the highest stylist level within four years and being promoted to Salon Manager in my fifth year. During this time, I discovered and honed my specialized skills in extensions and colour, which have since become my signature services.</p>
            <p>Building on this foundation, I took a bold step and opened my own salon, where I continue to express my creativity and deliver exceptional results to my clients. Alongside managing my salon, I’ve also had the privilege of working as a freelance representative for Schwarzkopf—a brand that played a significant role in shaping me into the stylist I am today. Through this partnership, I not only work with their professional products but also help educate and inspire other stylists across South Africa.</p>

            <p> We did a reverse balayage — which, for those unfamiliar, is a hair coloring technique where color is hand-painted onto the hair to create a soft, natural-looking gradient, usually going lighter toward the ends. In this case, we flipped the script: she had become too blonde and wanted to walk out of the salon as a seamless brunette. By adding depth and dimension back into her hair with deeper tones, we achieved a natural, blended result that still had movement and richness. I also shared some styling tips with her, including how to use Velcro rollers during her blow-dry routine to create maximum volume, and how to add some soft curls to enhance the final look.</p>
