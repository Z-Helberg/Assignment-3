# Portfolio Website Design Overview

## Styling and Design Choices

My portfolio website now uses CSS styles to create a clean visual and user-friendly experience.

## Color Palette

- Soft, muted background using combination of pink,purple and grey.
- Minimalist color chosen with black text to ensure optimal readability accordingly to https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.

## Typography/fonts

- Custom font "Prata" imported via `@font-face`.
- Multiple text styling where used to create seperate and emphise sections without overwhelming the reader.

## Layout and Spacing

- Responsive margin and padding controls for consistent spacing on different screen sizes.
- Flexbox used in navigation to display links next to each other
- text-align: center; for consistant look
- Flexible navigation layout with `space-between` alignment.

## Multimedia Handling

- Videos styled with `.video` class and centered alignment.
- Gray background for video sections to provide visual separation.


## Accessibility

- Added `aria-label` attributes to images and videos for screen readers.


## Design idea

This portfolio design aims to:

- Reflect my subtle and creative personality.
- Provide clear, intuitive navigation.
- Maintain a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Emphasize content readability with different font styling.
